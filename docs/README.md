# Overview

If you are developing your own plugin for Fuel, you will also need to prepare
the documentation set, which includes Test Plan, Test Report and Plugin Guide.

<div id='id-section2'/>
## How to use

This repo is organized as the doc tree with 2 main folders:
- plugin guide
- testing documentation
  - Test Plan
  - Test Report

To use these doc templates, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:

   `git clone git@github.com:Mirantis/fuel-plugin-docs.git`

2. Populate the placeholders of the conf.py files (for Plugin Guide, Test
   Plan and Report) with plugin-specific information (e.g. document name,
   plugin release).

3. Populate the content of RST files which make up the document structure.

<div id='id-section3'/>

## How to build documentation

Once you're done with editing the conf.py and sample RST files, you should cd
into the corresponding doc dir and run `make latexpdf`.

For example:
```
cd user_guide
make latexpdf
```

The PDF will be found in ./build subdir.

meets the acceptance criteria.

### Plugin Guide

* The Plugin Guide contains plugin version in <fuel-plugin-name>-XX-XXX-X
  format.
* The **Overview** section provides information on the following:

  * high-level description of plugin functionality/use case
  * schemes (optional)

* The **Requirements** section provides information on the following:

  * target MOS release (e.g. should be 8.0 not 8.0 and/or higher)
  * required compatible proprietary Partner product version
  * required compatible proprietary hw/software (if applicable)

* The **Prerequisites** section provides information on what should be done
  prior to the solution installation/configuration, specifically:

  * List of required HW/SW and how to get it (where to order or how to
    download).
  * Compatible firmware versions (for HW) and software versions (for SW).
  * A link to official documentation and configuration guides of used HW/SH
    should be provided.
  * How to configure required external hardware/software (e.g. storage devices,
    switches and so on) so that user could use them via the the
    application/driver. A simple configuration would be enough.
  * If the solution can use specific HW/SW in several modes, then there should
    be instructions on how to properly configure the hw/software to use this
    very mode.

* The **Limitations** should outline the issues that might limit the plugin
  usage. Those can be:

  * specific networking option available for the plugin (e.g. it can only use
    Neutron VXLAN)
  * known issues that might affect the plugin's operability (e.g. it's
    impossible to use non-ASCII characters)

* The **Release Notes** section should describe how this plugin version
  differs from the previous one.
* The **Installing the plugin** section provides commands and estimated output.
* The **Configuring the plugin** section provides the following information:

  * It's clarified which MOS environment configuration should be used (how
    many controller, computes, which options/services should be enabled). All
    links to the official Mirantis OpenStack documentation are present. It's
    also okay to provide screenshots.
  * It's clarified how to configure MOS environment properly for the plugin
    usage (e.g. how to configure interfaces for different logical networks
    Fuel uses). It's also okay to provide screenshots.
  * If the plugin requires specific role/naming convention, then this is also
    outlined.
  * UI part of the plugin should have detailed description and instructions on
    where to get specific params. This should be done for every field and
    example values should be provided.
  * If the plugin supports several modes of usage, then there should be a flow
    for each mode (e.g. each mode should be presented as the step-by-step
    instruction with screenshots with all required UI elements listed in the
    correct order): e.g. select plugin checkbox, click a radio button, fill
    in the text fields.

 * Network verification check is specified as the obligatory step prior to
   deployment. If itâ€™s expected to fail, this fact should be explicitly stated
   and a reason should be provided.
* The **User Guide** should contain:

  * baseline commands (CLI reference) with the estimated output (e.g. create
    volumes, list volumes etc)
  * links to external documentation (e.g. if all baseline issues are covered
    in open source/proprietary  documentation)

* The **Verification** section should explain how to verify that the plugin
  works as expected (CLI, expected output).
* The **Troubleshooting** section should deliver specific guidance on:

  * how to make sure that all services are running
  * how to check network connectivity (if needed)
  * logs (where to find those, what to pay attention to)
