The VMware DVS plugin
---------------------

MOS supports using vCenter as a hypervisor in a vCenter-only or
heterogeneous, mixed with KVM environments. There is the vmware\_dvs
driver for Neutron ML2 plugin which provides usage Neutron for
networking in such environments. Thereby environments receives an
advanced network features:

-  Ability to create multi-tier networks (e.g., web tier, db tier, app
   tier).

-  Control over IP addressing.

-  Ability to insert an configure their own services (e.g., firewall,
   IPS)

-  VPN/Bridge to remote physical hosting or customer premises.

* all the nodes of your future environment are discovered and functional.

* there is a connectivity to correctly configured vCenter with dvSwitch and clusters created. Please,
  see the `Mirantis OpenStack Planning Guide <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/planning-guide.html#vcenter-plan>`_, `User Guide <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7/user-guide.html#vmware-integration-notes>`_ and `this plugin's specification <https://github.com/openstack/fuel-plugin-vmware-dvs/blob/master/specs/fuel-plugin-vmware-dvs.rst>`_ for information on configuring vCenter.

Configuring VMware DVS plugin
-----------------------------

#. `Create a new OpenStack
   environment <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html#create-a-new-openstack-environment>`_
   with Fuel UI wizard.

   .. image:: pics/create.png

#. In *Compute* menu, select *vCenter* checkbox:

   .. image:: pics/compute.png

#. Select *Neutron with VLAN segmentation* for *Networking Setup* - it is
   the only networking configuration supported with VMware DVS plugin:

   .. image:: pics/net.png

#. Finish environment creation following
   `documentation <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html#create-a-new-openstack-environment>`_.

#. Open the *Nodes* tab and `add
   <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html#configure-your-environment>`__
   at least 1 Controller and 1 Compute node to the environment: 

   .. image:: pics/nodes-compute.png

   (Optional) You can also add 1 dedicated Compute VMware node:

   .. image:: pics/nodes-vmware.png

#. Open the *Settings* tab of the Fuel Web UI and scroll down the page. Select the
   *use Neutron VMware DVS ML2 plugin* checkbox and specify correct name of dvSwitch:

   .. image:: pics/settings.png

#. Fill in the VMware configuration fields on the *VMware* tab:

   .. image:: pics/vmware.png

   (Optional) Choose Compute VMware node if your environment has the role:

#. The rest of configuration is up to you.
   See `Mirantis OpenStack User Guide <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html>`__
   for instructions.

#. Click *Deploy changes* button to finish.

User Guide
----------

#. Once OpenStack has been deployed, we can start using Neutron for
   networking. The net04 port group should appear on the vCenter:

   .. image:: pics/net04pg.png

#. In Horizon, the network topology should look like:

   .. image:: pics/topology.png

   where VMware is the name of the instance located on the vCenter.

#. You can use Neutron for such instance brand the same way as for KVM-located instances.
