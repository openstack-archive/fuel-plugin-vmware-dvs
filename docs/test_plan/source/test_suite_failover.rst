Steps
#####

    1. Install DVS plugin on master node.
    2. Create a new environment with the following parameters:
        * Compute: KVM/QEMU with vCenter
        * Networking: Neutron with VLAN segmentation
        * Storage: default
        * Additional services: default
    3. Add nodes with following roles:
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Controller
        * Compute
        * Compute
    4. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    5. Configure network settings.
    6. Enable and configure DVS plugin.
    7. Configure VMware vCenter Settings. Add 2 vSphere clusters and configure Nova Compute instances on controllers.
    8. Verify networks.
    9. Deploy cluster.
    10. Run OSTF.
    11. Launch instances in nova and vcenter availability zones.
    12. Verify connection between instances. Send ping, check that ping get reply.

       Nova Compute instances on controllers.
    8. Verify networks.
    9. Deploy cluster.
    10. Run OSTF.
    11. Launch instance VM_1 with image TestVM, availability zone nova and flavor m1.micro.
    12. Launch instance VM_2 with image TestVM-VMDK, availability zone vcenter and flavor m1.micro.
    13. Check connection between instances, send ping from VM_1 to VM_2 and vice versa.
    14. Reboot vcenter.
    15. Check that controller lost connection with vCenter.
    16. Wait for vCenter.
    17. Ensure connectivity between instances.
    18. Run OSTF.


Expected result
