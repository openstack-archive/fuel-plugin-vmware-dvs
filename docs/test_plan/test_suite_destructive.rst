Steps
#####

    1. Setup for system tests.
    2. Log in to Horizon Dashboard.
    3. Navigate to Project ->  Compute -> Instances
    4. Launch instance VM_1 with image TestVM, availability zone nova and flavor m1.micro.
    5. Launch instance VM_2  with image TestVM-VMDK, availability zone  vcenter and flavor m1.micro.
    6. Verify that VMs  should communicate between each other. Send icmp ping from VM _1 to VM_2  and vice versa.
    7. Disable dvs_port of VM_1.
    8. Verify that VMs  should not communicate between each other. Send icmp ping from VM _2 to VM_1  and vice versa.
    9. Enable dvs_port of VM_1.
    10. Verify that VMs  should communicate between each other. Send icmp ping from VM _1 to VM_2  and vice versa.
